            There are four main directories on this website.<br><br>
            <u>Index:</u><br>This is the first page one is directed to when they arrive on this site.<br><br><br>
            <u>Home:</u><br>This page is meant to display information regarding the latest updates to tasseukeima.github.io.<br>
            Information about the overall functionality can be found here too.<br><br><br>
            <u>Main Board:</u><Br>This page is meant to replicate a conventional blog. I will often update this area with my 
            personal thoughts about my life and other things.<br> I may also talk about new features that could be implemented in the future.<br><br><br>
            <u>Archived:</u><br>There are 3 main sections to this page.<br><br>The "Internal Branch" is locked, but this is a page that I use to test new features on.
            The main reason it is locked is because half of the time it it broken and not functional.<br><br>The "Experimental Branch" is open for access, and
            used to give a snapshot of features that made it out of Internal.<br><br>The "Public Branch" is open and used to archive the changes made to the site, as well as give information about the current development status.
