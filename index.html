            As for functionality, I really don't think that there are any plans. I want to add cool buttons,
            better asthetic, and... just whatever really. Again, I'm a beginner to this so it will take me a while
            to really do anything.

            This is just the very basic outline for a website project. <br>
            I plan on updating this site frequently... err whenever I can. <br><br>
            EDIT: I'm trying to add color and fonts to this site. I want to at least make it look decent.
