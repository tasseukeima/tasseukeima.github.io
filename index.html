            I'm learning more CSS text properties and selectors. Today is a school day but I don't have to do anything
            really; most of what is done in class is honestly useless. The only class that is really worth listening to 
            is AP Physics. I don't pay attention in school and still manage to do well. I don't even know what the point 
            of this update is. I'm probably going to delete this later.<br><br>I talk as if anyone is listening.

            As for functionality, I really don't think that there are any plans. I want to add cool buttons,
            better asthetic, and... just whatever really. Again, I'm a beginner to this so it will take me a while
            to really do anything.

            This is just the very basic outline for a website project. <br>
            I plan on updating this site frequently... err whenever I can. <br><br>
            EDIT: I'm trying to add color and fonts to this site. I want to at least make it look decent.
