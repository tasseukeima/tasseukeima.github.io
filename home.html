            Update A3<br><br>
            A new update that changes the Header bar. I plan on releasing A4 this weekend, which will focus on the structure of Posts.
            I was planning on releasing the changes for both the Header and Posts under one update, but since I had not made any significant changes
            in a while, and A4 is only half way through complete development, I through I would split the update in two.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Font change to the logo / page names</li>
              <li>Color changes to the fonts</li>
              <li>New button animations</li>
              <li>New shaddow effects</li>
              <li>Internal code efficiency improvements</li>
            </ul>

            Update A2<br><br>
            Over the past couple of days, I've been working on a new design meant to simplify the aesthetic of the website.
            I feel that the usage of too many colors made everything so unprofessional. Overall, I'm trying to emulate the style of large social
            media platforms.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>A new dark aesthetic</li>
              <li>Various new hover effects</li>
              <li>Decrease in the number of colors</li>
              <li>Various font and shape changes</li>
              <li>Internal consistency changes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        </div>

            Update A1<br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Font Change</li>
              <li>Element Change</li>
              <li>Small Visual Changes</li>
              <li>Internal Organizational Changes</li>
              <li>New Page Directories</li>
            </ul>  
              <br>
              Overall, this site is coming together decently well. I'm changing the overall aesthetic to be more simplistic.
              I'm not exactly sure it that is a good thing...

            There are four main directories on this website.<br><br>
            Home:<br>This page is meant to display information regarding the latest updates to tasseukeima.github.io.<br>
            Information about the overall functionality can be found here too.<br><br><br>
            Main Board:<Br>This page is meant to replicate a conventional blog. I will often update this area with my 
            personal thoughts about my life and other things.<br> I may also talk about new features that could be implemented in the future.<br><br><br>
            Archived:<br>There are 3 main sections to this page.<br><br>The "Internal Branch" is locked, but this is a page that I use to test new features on.
            The main reason it is locked is because half of the time it it broken and not functional.<br><br>The "Experimental Branch" is open for access, and
            used to give a snapshot of features that made it out of Internal.<br><br>The "Public Branch" is open and used to archive the changes made to the site, as well as give information about the current development status.
